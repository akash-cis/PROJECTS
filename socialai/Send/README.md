# WebApp Front

This repository is the client side that consumes the WebApp API.
It is written in Javascript using the Gatsby framework.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### `yarn install`

If its your first time with the app please run this command, it will install all the necessary dependencies to run the project

### `yarn start`

This command runs `gatsby develop` which exposes a development server with hot reloadingat the port `8000`.

### `yarn storybook`

This runs a standalone [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) documentation app with all the components used in the project. It runs at the port `6006`.

## 🧐 What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project.

    ├── node_modules
    ├── src
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── .prettierrc
    ├── gatsby-browser.js
    ├── gatsby-config.js

1.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

2.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for “source code”.

3.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

4.  **`.prettierrc`**: This is a configuration file for [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent.

5.  **`gatsby-browser.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/browser-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.

6.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you’d like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

7.  **`gatsby-node.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby Node APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/node-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process.

8.  **`gatsby-ssr.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby server-side rendering APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/ssr-apis/) (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering.

9.  **`LICENSE`**: Gatsby is licensed under the MIT license.

10. **`package-lock.json`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. **(You won’t change this file directly).**

11. **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

12. **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.


## 💫 Deploy
The UI is hosted in S3 buckets and fronted by CloudFront distributions.

### Build
To build a distributable package run, for example for staging:

```
npm run build:stage
```

This will place the built files in the `public` folder

### Deploy
To deploy, copy the files in public up to the appropriate s3 bucket, for example to deploy to stage:

```
npm run deploy:stage
```

The files will now be up in the S3 bucket, since we're fronting these with CloudFront, it may be necessary to go to the CloudFront distribution in the AWS console and invalidate the cache before the updates will be visible to the world.
